== Releases
Release v1.0 corresponds to the code in the published book, without corrections or updates.

== Contributions
See the file Contributing.adoc for more information on how you can contribute to this repository.

== UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Version 5 of this book is being written so sources here will be changed to use Spring 5.x and Spring Boot 2.x


== Building and Deploying
This is a Gradle multi-module project. The *-practice projects, have tests and pieces left unimplemented so building the full project using:
----
gradle build
----
will fail.

In order to build the full project and skipping tests, build from the root  (`book-code`) directory:
----
gradle build -x test 
----
